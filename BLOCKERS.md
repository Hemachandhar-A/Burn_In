## 2026-09-25 P2 - scripts/seed.py's documented invocation can't import storage/
- Blocked on: `scripts/seed.py`'s own docstring says to run it as `uv run python scripts/seed.py`. With storage's `accounts` table and `save_account` now built (this session, P2.1), that invocation still fails with `No module named 'storage'` - not a signature mismatch (the call already matches `save_account(account_id, display_name, role, pin_hash)` exactly), but a `sys.path` issue: running a script by file path puts *its own* directory (`scripts/`) on `sys.path[0]`, not the repo root, so `storage` (a root-level package) isn't importable.
- What was tried: `uv run python scripts/seed.py` (fails as above); `uv run python -m scripts.seed` (works clean, seeds both accounts) - module invocation puts the repo root on `sys.path` instead. Not fixing this myself since `scripts/` is Lead-owned (AGENTS.md rule 2) and the fix is either a docstring/invocation change or a `sys.path` shim inside a Lead file, not a P2 change.
- Status: OPEN - for now, `uv run python -m scripts.seed` is the working invocation; every developer's local setup step should use that form until this is resolved one way or the other.
